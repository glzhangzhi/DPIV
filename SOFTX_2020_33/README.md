# PIV Image Generator

PIV Image Generator is a tool that generates synthetic Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) images with the purpose of validating and benchmarking PIV and Optical Flow methods in tracer based imaging for fluid mechanics.

This tool intends to be a reference library for reuse by anyone interested in evaluating said algorithms for velocimetry in fluid mechanics applications. 
The image generator can be used to create a reference central database for reporting and comparing benchmark results.

The image generator is easily extensible for other flow types.
